## Project Overview

Using Apache Spark, the project processes and analyzes two datasets:

### 1. Menu: Information about food items and their prices.
### 2. Sales: Data on customer orders, including dates, locations, and order sources.

Key insights derived from the analysis include:

- Total sales by year, month, and quarter.
- Top 5 ordered food items.
- Frequency of customer visits to restaurants.
- Sales analysis by country and order source.

## Key Functions in the Notebook

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the menu and sales datasets using predefined schemas.

### 2. Aggregations
- Calculate sales metrics by food category, customer, and order source.

### 3. Time Analysis
- Generate sales reports by year, quarter, and month.

### 4. Customer Behavior
- Track customer visits to restaurants and their spending patterns.

### 5. Visualization
- Present data insights using Spark's display feature.

## Objectives and Outcomes

The primary goal was to derive meaningful business insights to support decision-making. Below are the key questions addressed:

### 1. Customer Behavior
- What is the total spending by each customer?
- How frequently do customers visit restaurants?

### 2. Sales Trends
- What are the monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends?
- What is the sales performance across different countries?

### 3. Product Analysis
- Which food items are the most popular?
- How much revenue is generated by each product?

### 4. Order Insights
- Which platforms (e.g., Swiggy, Zomato) contribute the most to sales?
